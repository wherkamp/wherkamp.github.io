title: "Full Gradle Fever"

Starting a few weeks/months ago I made the move to use Gradle for all my projects. 
It started with Kakara's [Core](https://github.com/kakaragame/core). I fell in love that instead of being a list properties. Gradle was an actual build script. 
I started with Gradle Groovy but have ended up with Gradle Kotlin DLS. Converting all of Kakara's project to this. Starting this week I made my own Gradle Plugin [VersionFile](https://github.com/kakaragame/VersionFile)

To anyone who uses Maven I would say really look into Gradle. The learning curve is steeper. However, the rewards are great. 
I do know the Gradle can struggle to run on some lower end CPU's. This is one of my greatest problem going years with a PC that struggled to do anything. 

This is one of my greatest loves of Gradle
```kotlin
version = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"
if (hasProperty("buildNumber")) {
    version = "1.0-" + properties.get("buildNumber") + "-SNAPSHOT";
}
```
Allowing you to do things like this allows me to do things with my Jenkins Instance and makes me really happy.

To my Spigot devs [PDM](https://github.com/knightzmc/pdm) is a really cool tool. It allows you to import Gradle depend's through the PluginClassLoader



P.S [StrongBox](https://strongbox.github.io/) is great for depend hosting.

Thank you,
